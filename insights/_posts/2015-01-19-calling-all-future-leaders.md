When running a business, it is very important to grow and develop as the world changes around you. If you don't grow and develop, your business will eventually become extinct.

It is equally important not to rush into any decision without careful consideration of all the options and the foreseeable consequences. A wrong decision can be very costly to your business and the last thing that any business operator wants is to cause their own business demise.

A successful business operator will be someone that has vision for the future with enough caution to not head in the wrong direction but enough conviction to keep moving forward. A successful business operator will surround themselves with people and organisations that can help to foster that growth and development and share their vision.

But visions and ideas also grow and develop and need those people and organisations to continue to grow and develop too.

Quite often, business operators will believe loyalty from these other people and organisations, often shown through long term employees and favourable trading terms, is a sign of a strong business.

But loyalty alone is often the cause of a businesses demise. If those same loyal employees and organisations are not keeping up with the changes, and even helping you to see the future and make those changes, they will hold you and your business back from continuing to succeed in the future.

Future business leaders must show their ability to grow and develop, not just out of necessity but from their deep desire to drive for success. Future leaders that think their success will come from mastering the old ways will be outpaced by their peers who look for new ways to do things better.

Good luck. See you at the finish line.
